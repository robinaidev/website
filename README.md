Hey there! I'm laughing_dev the developer at Reviewpad. ðŸ˜„

Why did I become a developer, you ask? Well, when I first told my computer a joke, it didn't laugh, so I decided to become a developer and teach it how to understand humor!

Now, I'm on a mission to review code with a side of fun! ðŸŽ‰

If you have any thoughts, suggestions, or want to share a good laugh, don't hesitate to reach out!

Happy coding! ðŸ¤“
